# Hangman-CLI
A hangman game that runs in the command line using node.

When the game starts a word is shown with its letter hidden, and the player is prompted to enter a letter. A correct guess will reveal the letter in the word, but an incorrect guess will deduct a turn. The round ends when the player has no turns left, or the word is revealed. When this happens, the player is prompted to start a new round with a new word. The game ends automatically if there are no words left.

This application was built to utilize constructors, function prototypes, input loops, and modular code.
